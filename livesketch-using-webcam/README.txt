LIVE SKETCH USING WEBCAM
this project captures live video from a webcam and applies a sketch effect to the video in real-time.
the resulting output displays the sketch-like appearance of the captured frames,providing a "live sketch" effect.


##key features:
real-time processing: continuously captures video from the webcam and converts it to a skeych format in real-time.

edge detction:
uses edge detection techniques to create a sketch effect from the live video feed.

simple and efficient: the implementation is optimized fro real-time performance and can run smoothy on most systems.

how it works:
the webcam captures video frames.
each frame is processed using image,processing techniques sich as gaussian blurring, edge detection,and binary thresholding to
convert the frame into a sketch.

the processed frames are displayed in real-time as a live video stream with the sketch effect.

requirements:
python3.x
opencv
